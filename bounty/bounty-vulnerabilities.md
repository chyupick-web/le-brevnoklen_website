##### Background

**Vyral:** The First Incentivised Crypto Sharing for Engineered Viral Campaigns with Peer-to-Peer
Advertising Powered by Ethereum.

The Vyral Security Team will maintain a bounty program to encourage security investigation that can be used to benefit the Bitcoin community.

##### Scope

Any web services operated by Vyral are considered in scope for this program.

The following list of bugs will likely qualify for a reward:

 - Any fault in Vyral services that substantially compromises the integrity or confidentiality of user data.  Some examples that fall into this category:

  + Authentication and authorization mechanism faults;
  + Command injection bugs;
  + Cross-site scripting, cross-site script inclusion and cross-site request forgery;
  + Mixed scripting; and
  + Server-side code execution.


Some examples that do not merit a reward:

  - Application of SEO tactics;
  - Attacks on physical facilities or Vyral infrastructure;
  - Brute force denial of service faults;
  - Involvement of social engineering;
  - Vulnerabilities in non web applications and in services operated by third parties.

  - There are also exceptional cases such as bugs that are reproducible only through the use of out-of-date browsers or plugins; which will also not qualify for a reward.

For the sake of Vyral's availability, you are asked to avoid using any tools that create unusual amounts of traffic or conducting any behavior that will disrupt other users.

##### Payouts

Reward payouts range from between 1000 and 100,000 **SHAREs**. Decisions concerning the rewards are made at Vyral's sole discretion.  For example, Vyral may elect to pay out higher rewards for the discovery of unusually severe or skillful exploits.

##### Disclosure

Vyral will cooperate with a coordinated bug disclosure policy, and will make best efforts to respond to vulnerabilities as soon as possible after receiving advance notification.  Parties who do not observe this policy or who do not avoid disclosing flaws to third parties will most likely be disqualified from receiving a reward.

Only the first person to report a previously undiscovered vulnerability will qualify for a reward, although smaller bounties may still be given to other contributors.

We plan to acknowledge all significant contributors publicly unless you tell us you prefer to remain anonymous.  

All rewards shall be paid after the Crowd-sale.
